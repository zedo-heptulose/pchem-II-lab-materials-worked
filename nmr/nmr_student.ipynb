    "For our NMR spectrum, the locations of peaks will depend on the energy required to excite a transition between the alpha and beta state of the nucleus, given by $\\Delta{}E = \\gamma(1-\\alpha)B_0$. However, the resolution and intensity of those peaks will depend on two other parameters: $T_1$ and $T_2$.\n",

    "#### Transverse Relaxation ($T_2$ Decay)\n",

    "In the previous section, we described the __free induction decay (FID)__ as a damped oscillation. The oscillation comes from precession at the Larmor frequency, but what causes the damping?\n",

    "#### Longitudinal Relaxation ($T_1$ Decay)\n",

    "$T_1$ relaxation describes the return of longitudinal magnetization $(M_z)$ to equilibrium. It occurs as spins exchange energy with the lattice, allowing them to relax to the lower-energy $\\alpha$ state. This is also called spin-lattice relaxation.\n",
