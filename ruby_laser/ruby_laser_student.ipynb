    "### Ruby Fluorescence Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In our experiment, the fluorescence process in ruby follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our Nd:YAG laser excites Cr$^{3+}$ ions in the ruby lattice from the ground state (⁴A₂) to an excited state (⁴T₂)\n",
    "- From the ⁴T₂ state, rapid thermal relaxation occurs to the slightly lower energy ²E excited state\n",
    "- The ion then emits a photon and relaxes back to the ground state\n",
    "\n",
    "This emission pathway is the source of photons used in ruby lasers. However, competing processes can occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Radiative relaxation directly from the ⁴T₂ state\n",
    "- Non-radiative relaxation from the ⁴T₂ state (where energy is lost as heat)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these alternative pathways are temperature-dependent, which is why we'll examine how fluorescence lifetime changes with temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Fluorescence Lifetime\n",
    "\n",
    "For a decaying exponential of the form e⁻ᵗ/ᵗᵃᵘ:\n",
    "\n",
    "- τ (tau) represents the fluorescence lifetime\n",
    "- This is the time required for the intensity to decay to 1/e (approximately 37%) of its initial value\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experimental data consists of fluorescence intensity versus time, which should follow this exponential decay pattern. To extract the lifetime:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the signal (intensity) to its natural logarithm\n",
    "2. Perform linear regression on the resulting straight line\n",
    "3. The negative reciprocal of the slope gives us τ\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have collected nearly 100 such decay curves at different temperatures, we'll need to develop a function that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Process a single decay curve to extract the lifetime\n",
    "- Be applied systematically to our entire dataset\n",

Lifetime measurements are kinetic data. In our ruby system, we're considering three energy levels with three relaxation pathways, each with its own rate constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Radiative relaxation from the $^2E$ state (rate constant $A_E$)\n",
    "- Radiative relaxation from the $^4T_2$ state (rate constant $A_T$)\n",
    "- Nonradiative (thermal) relaxation from the $^4T_2$ state (rate constant $N(T)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed fluorescence lifetime $\\tau$ is related to the overall relaxation rate by:\n",
    "$$\n",
