    "\n",
    "In our experiment, the fluorescence process in ruby follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our Nd:YAG laser excites Cr$^{3+}$ ions in the ruby lattice from the ground state (⁴A₂) to an excited state (⁴T₂)\n",
    "- From the ⁴T₂ state, rapid thermal relaxation occurs to the slightly lower energy ²E excited state\n",

    "- Radiative relaxation directly from the ⁴T₂ state\n",
    "- Non-radiative relaxation from the ⁴T₂ state (where energy is lost as heat)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these alternative pathways are temperature-dependent, which is why we'll examine how fluorescence lifetime changes with temperature.\n",

    "### Measuring Fluorescence Lifetime\n",
    "\n",
    "For a decaying exponential of the form e⁻ᵗ/ᵗᵃᵘ:\n",
    "\n",
    "- τ (tau) represents the fluorescence lifetime\n",
    "- This is the time required for the intensity to decay to 1/e (approximately 37%) of its initial value\n",
