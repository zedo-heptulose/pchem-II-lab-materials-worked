# photoelectric scratch notes
probably get rid of the processing multiple spectra different ways thing.
I think we just truncate the zero values and do a linear trendline, nothing else makes sense.
I'll get a better sense for how this should go if I'm using the worked version for my scratch and not the student handout version.
I think I have a solid vision for this; I don't need to bloat it and I already have all the code we need.

yeah we're pretty much there, we've got it...
Letting them do the vlab for the first part of this might be good?
But I don't get why they're gonna do a vlab of something they're doing in real life

Eh, we do our best
I think I just need to make sure that ... I'm going through the actual concepts and not just programming
This is just like going through using an instrument. 

The concept I want to demonstrate here is thinking through how you would set up the problem and solve it.
and then just using the code to *do* that. 

But that's hard to do, some students just won't get it if I make it too open ended.
I'm on a tight deadline anyways. I'll stick with what I have and make it good. We'll see how students
respond, then we can adjust.

The more important thing is making a cheatsheet for students so that they don't trip over basic syntax.
